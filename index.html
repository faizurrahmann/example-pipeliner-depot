<h2>General</h2>
<p>This pipeliner depot consists of example pipelines and stages to showcase
  how to utilize Pipeliner.</p>
<p>To learn more about the setup test, extend and use Pipeliner, refer to the
  <a href="https://github.com/Daimler/pipeliner">Pipeliner documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Using pipelines</h2>
<p>The Pipeline executators are automatically available in Jenkinsfiles
  because both Pipeliner (as a git submodule) and this example-pipeliner-depot
  are loaded as shared libraries in Jenkins. Here is an example Jenkinsfile:</p>
<p>
  <pre>
    @Library('example-pipeliner-depot@master') _
    execComponentPipeline()
  </pre>
</p>
<p>The first line tells Jenkins which vesion of the
  <em>example-pipeliner-depot</em> to use, in this case master, and the
  <code>execComponentPipeline()</code> is a wrapper function which initializes
  the specific pipeline and runs it. The intention of that wrapper is to be
  able to connect different pipelines.</p>
<p>Please be aware of the fact that each pipeline uses stages which have many
  sideeffects and requirements.</p>
